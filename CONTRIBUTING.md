# Contributing

We're always looking for your help to improve the product (bug fixes, new features, documentation, etc).

## Process details

Please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/abelyo252/AKeyword_Spotting/issues) for a similar idea first: there may already be an issue you can contribute to.

1. **Create Issue**
To propose a new feature or API please start by filing a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/abelyo252/AKeyword_Spotting/issues).
Include as much detail as you have. It's fine if it's not a complete design: just a summary and rationale is a good starting point.

2. **Discussion**
We'll keep the issue open for community discussion until it has been resolved or is deemed no longer relevant.
Note that if an issue isn't a high priority or has many open questions then it might stay open for a long time.


3. **Implementation**
* A feature can be implemented by you.  Code contributions are greatly appreciated: feel free to work on any reviewed feature you proposed. If you are new to the project and want to work on an existing issue, we recommend starting with issues that are tagged with “good first issue”. Please let us know in the issue comments if you are actively working on implementing a feature so we can ensure it's assigned to you.
